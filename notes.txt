Week 2 - CSS

Day 1

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
    - Gives style to raw HTML
    - Allows for CONSISTENT styling
    - Used to make web pages responsive
        - How your page caters to different devices
        - Aids in creating accessible sites
    - makes the website modern looking and attractive
    - Seperartion of concepts, HTML and CSS separated in order to avoid confusion
    - Dry; do not repeat (ensuring no duplication of effort)
    
p{
    property : value;
}

    - selectors can be separated with a , if you want them to have the same values

p, h1, span{

    color : red
}

-- Three ways to join CSS to HTML
    - Internal ; In the <head> section of the document
    - External ; Using <link rel="stylesheet" href="name of sheet here">
    - Inline ; Using <style> on a specific element, can be used to customise an individual element.


Inline > internal/External
Internal/External : Only matters where the code appears in the code, unless you use the !important tag.

Selectors in CSS    
    - Finds the element whose property is to be set. Types;
        a. element selector
        b. id selector
        c. class selector
        d. grouping selector
    
    - id, defined by # 
    - class, defined by .
    - grouping e.g p, h1, span

FONTS
    - Web safe fonts; common fonts that come pre-installed with OS
    - Web Fonts; Downloaded from the internet (Google Fonts is a good resource)


Day 2

English and Maths
    - American English is what we right code in so no u's and lots of z's
    - Maths is mainly JS, though can use %'s in CSS



Margins and Padding 
    - Margins:
        Margins refer to the space around an element, which creates a gap between the element and other elements in its vicinity. 
        Margins can be set on all four sides of an element (top, right, bottom, and left) individually, or you can use shorthand notation to set them simultaneously. 
        Margins are used to create spacing between elements and affect the overall layout of a web page.

    - Padding:
        Padding refers to the space between the content of an element and its border. It is the area inside the element, between the content and the border itself. 
        Similar to margins, padding can be set on all four sides individually or using shorthand notation. Padding is used to control the spacing between the content and the border of an element.
    

Colors
    - How to apply color to different elements
        - By name 
        - By RGB (Red,Green,Blue); specify value from 0 - 255
        - By Hex -- This is the preferred method within the industry at the moment as it allows for clearer setting of colors than RGB or name
        - By HSLa (Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Alpha value)
            - Hue : Degree of the field from 0 - 360 (0 - Red, 120 - Green, 240 - Blue)
            - Saturation : %age value 
            - Lightness : %age value 0% - Black, 50% somewhere between, 100% - White
            - Alpha : Opacity

Display Properties
    - inline
    - block
    - inline-block

CSS Positions
    - Static (Default)
    - Relative - relative to normal position and leaves a gap in it's normal position
    - Absolute - relative to it's first parent position
    - Sticky - combination of fixed and relative, element remains in sticky position whilst scrolling.
    - Fixed - Remains fixed to a position on the screen even if scrolling happens, top,left,right,bottom. 


Benefit of sticky:
    Sticky is useful when
