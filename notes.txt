    - Seperartion of concepts, HTML and CSS separated in order to avoid confusion
    - Dry; do not repeat (ensuring no duplication of effort)
    
p{
    property : value;
}

    - selectors can be separated with a , if you want them to have the same values

p, h1, span{

    color : red
}

-- Three ways to join CSS to HTML
    - Internal ; In the <head> section of the document
    - External ; Using <link rel="stylesheet" href="name of sheet here">
    - Inline ; Using <style> on a specific element, can be used to customise an individual element.


Inline > internal/External
Internal/External : Only matters where the code appears in the code, unless you use the !important tag.

    - Finds the element whose property is to be set. Types;
        a. element selector
        b. id selector

    - id, defined by #
